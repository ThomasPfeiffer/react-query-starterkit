# Tanstack Query (React Query) Starter Kit

Small playground Project to get to know React Query. Contains a backend based on [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) and a frontend based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and of course [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/overview).

Each page contains some tasks you fullfill by adjusting the code of the page itself. [https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/devtools](React Query Devtools) are enabled by default, you should use them in combination with the [https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/overview](official docs) to fullfill the tasks.

## Quick Start

- Open a terminal in _backend_
- Run npm install
- Run npm start

- Open a second terminal in _frontend_
- Run npm install
- Run npm start
